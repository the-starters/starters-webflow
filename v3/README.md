# V3 browser scripts

## Scheduling auth

`scheduling-auth.js` owns the Bearer-token adapter for the V3 availability and
scheduling configuration calls. Webflow should load it with a small `defer`
script tag instead of carrying a duplicate copy in page head/footer code.

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/the-starters/starters-webflow@latest/v3/scheduling-auth.js"></script>
```

Current safety boundary:

- Runs only on `the-starters-3-0.webflow.io`.
- Does not change V2 or either V3 custom domain.
- Authenticates only paths beginning with `/api:tCpV3oqd/scheduler/configurations/`
  or `/api:tCpV3oqd/calendars/get_availabilities` on the configured Xano origin.
- Caches the Xano token and retries once after a `401`; a failed refresh returns
  the original `401`.
- Invalidates cached and in-flight authentication when the Memberstack session changes.
- Exposes `window.getXanoAuthToken` and `window.xanoAuthFetch` for page-owned
  code.
- Transparently wraps the two scheduling path families while legacy inline
  Webflow callers are migrated.
- Installs synchronously and takes ownership from the legacy bridge in
  `opportunities-3.0.js` regardless of script order.

Maintenance rule: new `api:tCpV3oqd` scheduling calls should use
`window.xanoAuthFetch`. Keep endpoint scope explicit; do not turn this into a
blanket credential injector.

Public helpers:

- `window.xanoAuthFetch(input, init)` accepts the same inputs as `fetch`, adds
  Bearer authentication for the two scoped path families, and rejects if initial
  token acquisition fails. Calls outside that scope and calls with an existing
  `Authorization` header pass through unchanged.
- `window.getXanoAuthToken({ forceRefresh: true })` returns the cached,
  member-scoped token or explicitly replaces it. The options argument is
  optional.

The transparent `window.fetch` wrapper exists only for legacy inline callers. If
initial token acquisition fails, it logs a warning and makes one unauthenticated
request; direct `xanoAuthFetch` callers receive the error. Both interfaces preserve
network rejections and reject with code `MEMBER_SCOPE_CHANGED` if the Memberstack
session changes while authentication or a scheduling request is in flight.

Run the focused test with:

```sh
node v3/scheduling-auth.test.js
```
