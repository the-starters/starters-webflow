# Starters Webflow CDN Scripts

This folder is the local checkout for:

```txt
https://github.com/the-starters/starters-webflow
```

Treat the GitHub repo under the `the-starters` org as the source of truth for these browser-facing Webflow CDN scripts.

## Before Editing

Always check GitHub first so local work does not overwrite code updated by someone else:

```sh
git fetch origin
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -5
```

If `main` is behind `origin/main`, pull or rebase before editing. If local files are modified, inspect them before pulling:

```sh
git diff
git diff --stat
```

Do not discard local changes unless the user explicitly asks.

## Sync Safety

- Assume GitHub may have newer code than this local folder.
- Do not force-push.
- Do not overwrite remote changes with stale local files.
- If a push is rejected, fetch and review the remote changes before trying again.
- For Webflow footer work, prefer loading scripts from the GitHub/jsDelivr CDN at `@latest` with `defer`, so new tagged releases do not require a Webflow URL edit.

## Current Scripts

- `quiz-results.js`
- `quiz-results.min.js`
- `opportunities-3.0.js`
- `v3/messages.js` — self-contained Memberstack + TalkJS inbox bootstrap for `/messages`
- `opportunities---create.js`
- `all-starters/apply-button-disable.js`
- `all-starters/range-backfill.js`
- `utils/loader.js` — env-switch script loader (`loadEnvScript`)
- `utils/wf-validate.js` — declarative form validation (see below)
- `explore-search/explore-search-chip-fill.js` — chip click copies its text into the search input, fires the engine's `input` event, announces `explore-search:commit`
- `explore-search/explore-search-tab-counts.js` — live per-index hit counts for the tab bar (intercepts the engine's own Algolia responses; zero extra operations)
- `explore-search/explore-search-most-searched.js` — dynamic "Most Searched" chips from an Algolia Query Suggestions index, via a designer-owned template
- `explore-search/explore-search-recent-searches.js` — the user's recent searches as chips, persisted in localStorage, recorded via `explore-search:commit`
- `explore-search/explore-search-default-results.js` — keeps results visible on an empty query and fills each federated section with its index's default ranking
- `explore-search/explore-search-hide-empty.js` — hides `[starters-algolia-hide]` wrappers while all their Algolia sections are empty
- `explore-search/explore-search-list-loader.js` — shows a loader and masks list jank during result transitions (arms on first user interaction; force-hides the loader at init)
- `explore-search/explore-search-demo.html` — standalone demo page for the explore-search embeds (source-of-truth reference, not CDN-loaded)
- `explore-search-transitions/explore-search-transitions.js` — search overlay open/close transitions (GSAP timelines, inert-locked closed state)
- `explore-search-transitions/explore-search-transitions.css` — companion styles for the search overlay transitions

## utils/wf-validate.js

Attribute-driven form validation, same grammar family as wf-xano / Finsweet Attributes.
Wraps the native Constraint Validation API: rules come from the attributes Webflow's
Designer already sets (`required`, `type`, `pattern`, `min/max`, `minlength/maxlength`);
the script renders styled error elements instead of the native browser bubbles and
blocks invalid submits before Webflow's handler or page controllers see them.

```html
<form wf-validate-element="form">
  <input name="Email" type="email" required
         wf-validate-message-required="Please enter your email."
         wf-validate-message-type="That doesn't look like an email." />
  <div wf-validate-element="error">Replaced with the message at runtime</div>
</form>
```

- Roles: `wf-validate-element="form | error | message | count | submit"`. Error/count
  slots bind to the nearest field, or explicitly via `wf-validate-for="<input name>"`.
- Invalid forms are gated on BOTH the submit event and clicks on submit buttons —
  page controllers that bind click and call the API directly (the opp30 modal
  pattern) never fire while the form is invalid. Put `wf-validate-element="submit"`
  on clickables outside the form or on wrapper divs that carry the click handler
  (e.g. the `data-opp-submit` button wrappers).
- `count` is a live character counter ("1,234 / 2,500") — max from the field's
  `maxlength` or `wf-validate-count-max`. (Finsweet's "inputcounter" is a number
  stepper, not a char counter — this fills that gap.)
- An invalid field with no error slot gets a plain one auto-injected (class
  `wf-validate_error-auto`), so a gated form never blocks submission invisibly.
- `minlength`/`maxlength` are enforced by the script itself (native tooShort/tooLong
  only fire for user-typed values, so JS-set/autofilled values would bypass them).
- Messages: `wf-validate-message-<rule>` on the input (`required`, `type`, `pattern`,
  `minlength`, `maxlength`, `min`, `max`, `step`, `match`), `wf-validate-message` as
  catch-all, browser default text as fallback.
- Extras: `wf-validate-match="<name>"` (confirm-field rule); hidden (`display:none`)
  fields are skipped, so per-variant required inputs don't block submit.
- Styling is 100% Webflow-side: style the error element itself (inline text or
  absolutely-positioned bubble) and the `is-wf-validate-invalid` class on fields.
- Full grammar and behavior notes in the header of `utils/wf-validate.js`.

Client-side validation is UX only — Xano bridge endpoints must keep validating
server-side.

After browser-facing changes, scan for accidental private exposure before publishing or tagging:
